=======
Metrics
=======

*Auto-sklearn* supports various built-in metrics, which can be found in the
:ref:`metrics section in the API <api:Built-in Metrics>`. However, it is also
possible to define your own metric and use it to fit and evaluate your model.
The following examples show how to use built-in and self-defined metrics for a
classification problem.

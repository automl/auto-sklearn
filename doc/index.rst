What is auto-sklearn?

*auto-sklearn* is an automated machine learning toolkit and a drop-in
replacement for a scikit-learn estimator:

    >>> import autosklearn.classification
    >>> cls = autosklearn.classification.AutoSklearnClassifier()
    >>> cls.fit(X_train, y_train)
    >>> predictions = cls.predict(X_test, y_test)

*auto-sklearn* frees a machine learning user from algorithm selection and
hyperparameter tuning. It leverages recent advantages in *Bayesian
optimization*, *meta-learning* and *ensemble construction*. Learn more about
the technology behind *auto-sklearn* by reading this paper published at
the `NIPS 2015 <http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5872-efficient-and-robust-automated-machine-learning.pdf>`_
.

Example
*******

    >>> import autosklearn.classification
    >>> import sklearn.cross_validation
    >>> import sklearn.datasets
    >>> import sklearn.metrics
    >>> digits = sklearn.datasets.load_digits()
    >>> X = digits.data
    >>> y = digits.target
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = \
            sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)
    >>> automl = autosklearn.classification.AutoSklearnClassifier()
    >>> automl.fit(X_train, y_train)
    >>> y_hat = automl.predict(X_test)
    >>> print("Accuracy score", sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_hat))


This will run for one hour should result in an accuracy above 0.98.


Installation
************
**Prerequisities**: *auto-sklearn* is written in python and was developed
with Ubuntu. It should run on other Linux distributions, but won't work on a MAC
or on a windows PC. We aim to always support the two latests python versions,
which are 3.4 and 3.5 at the moment. It is built around scikit-learn 0.17.1 and
needs a compiler for C++ 11. On Ubuntu you can provide a C++ 11 building environment
by running:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

One of *auto-sklearn*'s python dependencies (pyrfr) depends on swig-3.0 or later 
to be built. On ubuntu swig can be installed with:

.. code:: bash
    
    sudo apt-get install swig

If you're not using ubuntu please check how to install swig-3.0 or later on your distribution.     

Please install all dependencies manually with:

.. code:: bash

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automl/auto-sklearn/master/requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip install

Then install *auto-sklearn*

.. code:: bash

    pip install auto-sklearn

We recommend installing *auto-sklearn* into a `virtual environment
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_.

Contributing
************

We appreciate all contribution to auto-sklearn, from bug reports,
documentation to new features. If you want to contribute to the code, you can
pick an issue from the `issue tracker <https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn/issues>`_
which is marked with `Needs contributer`.

.. note::

    To avoid spending time on duplicate work or features that are unlikely to
    get merged, it is highly advised that you contact the developers
    by opening a `github issue <https://github
    .com/automl/auto-sklearn/issues>`_ before starting to work.

When developing new features, please create a new branch from the development
branch. Prior to submitting a pull request, make sure that all tests are
still passing.

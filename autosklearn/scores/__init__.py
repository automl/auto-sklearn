# Score library for NUMPY arrays
# ChaLearn AutoML challenge

# For regression:
# solution and prediction are vectors of numerical values of the same dimension

# For classification:
# solution = array(p,n) of 0,1 truth values, samples in lines, classes in columns
# prediction = array(p,n) of numerical scores between 0 and 1 (analogous
# to probabilities)

'''    read_sparse_file (filename, num_features, num_points)

    Reads the data from a file containing sparse data into a scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (type float32).
    
    The number of features and the number of points have to be known ahead of time.
    Each pair is "index:value" and the row in the file equals the row in the matrix.
    The labels are assumed to be in a different file, in contrast to the SVMlight file format where the "target value" would be the first entry    in each line!
    The optional argument initial_length should estimate the number of elements    expected in the data set. If it is to small all arrays will be dynamically enlarged in steps of initial_length. If chosen to small, unnecessary reallocations slow things down. If to big, memory might be wasted while    loading the data.
    The optional argument offset should be -1 if the indices in the file start at 1! This is the case for the automl challenge, hence the default value.
    So far, only ascii #32 (space) is recognized as a whitespace. If the entries are tab-separated (or any other chararcter), this could easily be implemented here.

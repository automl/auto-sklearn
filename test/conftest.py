Testing
=======
The following are some features, guidelines and functionality for testing which makes
updating, adding and refactoring tests easier, especially as features and functionality
changes.

**Marks**
* todo - ``pytest.mark.todo``` to mark a test which xfails as it's todo
* slow - ``pytest.mark.slow``` to mark a test which is skipped if `pytest --fast`

**Documenting Tests**
To ease in understanding of tests, what is being tested and what's expected of the test,
each test should doc expected bhaviour, not describe the steps of the test.
Commenst relating to how a test does things can be left in the tests and not the doc.

    Expects
    -------
    * Something should raise a ValueError when called with X as X is not handled by the
      validator Y.

**Test same module across files**
When a module has many complicated avenues to be tested, create a folder and split the
tests according to each avenue. See `test/test_automl` for example as the `automl.py`
module is quite complicated to test and all tests in a single file become difficult to
follow and change.

**pytest_cases**
Using pytest_cases, we seperate a `case`, something that defines the state of the
object, from the actual `test`, which tests properties of these cases.

A complicated example can be seen at `test/test_automl/cases.py` where we have
autoML instances that are classifier/regressor, fitted or not, with cv or holdout,
or fitted with no ensemble. TODO: Easier example.

Docs: https://smarie.github.io/python-pytest-cases/

**Caching**
Uses pytest's cache functionality for long training models so they can be shared between
tests and between different test runs. This is primarly used with `cases` so that tests
requiring the same kind of expensive case and used cached values.

Use `pytest --cached` to use this feature.

See `test/test_automl/cases.py` for example of how the fixtures from
`test/fixtures/caching.py` can be used to cache objects between tests.

**Fixtures**
All fixtures in "test/fixtures" are known in every test file. We try to make use
of fixture `factories` which can be used to construct objects in complicated ways,
removing these complications from the tests themselves, importantly, keeping tests
short. A convention we use is to prefix them with `make`, for example,
`make_something`. This is useful for making data, e.g. `test/fixtures/data::make_data`

..code:: python

    # Example of fixture factory
    @fixture
    def make_something():
        def _make(...args):
            # ... complicated setup
            # ... more complications
            # ... make some sub objects which are complicated
            return something

        return _make

    @parametrize("arg1", ['a', 'b', 'c'])
    def test_something_does_x(arg1, make_something):
        something = make_something(arg1, ...)
        result = something.run()
        assert something == expected

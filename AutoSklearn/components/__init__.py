"""AutoSklearn can be easily extended with new classification and
preprocessing methods. At import time, AutoSklearn checks the directory
``AutoSklearn/components/classification`` for classification algorithms and
``AutoSklearn/components/preprocessing`` for preprocessing algorithms. To be
found, the algorithm must be provide a class implementing one of the given
interfaces.
